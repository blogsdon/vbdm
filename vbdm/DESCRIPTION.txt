Description: Efficient algorithm for solving discrete mixture
		regression model for rare variant association analysis.
		Uses variational Bayes algorithm to efficiently search over
		model space.  Outputs an approximate likelihood ratio test
		as well as variant level posterior probabilities of
		association.
